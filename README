NOTE

I've received reports that users of the original free version are now required to
pay for updates. This is definitely not acceptable.

I am investigating the cause, and will change the application back to free if there
is no other remedy for this.

In case of questions, feel free to use the issue tracker or send me e-mail at
quickbeer@ztesch.fi.

Cheers,
apoi
